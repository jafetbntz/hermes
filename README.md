Project Hermes | Another toy project
=========================================

I started Project Hermes as an experiment for replicating Strava's maps snapshot features. The project contains a microservice to receive a list of coordinates (a path) and generates a map snapshot drawing the path for those coordinates through a call to MapBox's Static Images API


## To Do:

- Notify the generation of the snapshot through some push notification service and/or some WebSocket channel
